# Grooovin
Simple React web app that queries Spotify's API to add songs to a playlist, and save to user's account.

This app was a coding project serving to strengthen front-end app development using React, along with some HTML/CSS and javascript.
The objectives to be implemented through this app were as follows:

- Allow user to add a song from the search results to the user’s custom playlist  
- Allow user to remove tracks from custom playlist  
- Allow user to change the name of their playlist  
- Obtain a Spotify user's access token  
- Send a search request to the Spotify API  
- Save a user’s playlist to their Spotify account
